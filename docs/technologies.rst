Technologies and Programming Languages used
======================================================

The Orange County Lettings project uses a combination of modern technologies and
of robust programming languages to provide a reliable and efficient solution.
This section provides an overview of the main technological elements employed
as part of the development of the application.

1 - Programming Languages
-----------------------------
Python (3.12): The primary programming language used for application development.
Python offers clear and concise syntax, promoting rapid and efficient development.

2 - Development Framework
--------------------------
Django (3.0): A highly productive and robust web development framework for Python.
Django makes it easy to create complex web applications by providing an organized structure,
easy database management and built-in security features.

3 - Dependency Management Tools
------------------------------------
pip: The package management tool for Python.
Pip is used to install and manage project dependencies,
guaranteeing a consistent development environment.

4 - Error Tracking
---------------------
Sentry: An error tracking platform that helps detect, diagnose and resolve
quickly fix problems in the application.
Sentry provides deep visibility into errors and exceptions,
facilitating maintenance and continuous improvement of the application.

5 - Containerization
--------------------
Docker: A containerization platform that allows you to package an application
and its dependencies in a container.
Docker makes it easy to deploy the application consistently across different platforms.

6 - Documentation Tool
--------------------------
Sphinx: A documentation generator used to create documentation
structured and user-friendly for the project.
Sphinx allows you to generate consistent documentation, including user guides,
code references and API information.

7 - Continuous Integration Tool
--------------------------------
GitHub Actions: A continuous integration (CI) service that automates tasks such as code review,
test execution and deployment, ensuring consistent code quality and successful deployments.


This combination of technologies provides a solid foundation for development,
testing and deployment of the Orange County Lettings application,
ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.
